            <p>My name is James Etukudo Jr. Close friends and family call me JB. I can't even remember how that nick name came about. I am trying my hands on web develpment as a way to test the waters before making a full switch in career. I am currently in the business management industry, with specifics in project management. I am greatly excited by the prospects of becoming a seasoned web and softeare developer sometime in the future, ofcourse with enough practice and experience.</p>
